## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the data-science-project! This application helps you explore the quality of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines using various data science techniques. You will analyze data, build machine learning models, and visualize the results—all without needing programming knowledge.

### ✅ Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data through visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Improve model performance with better input data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict wine quality using popular algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy and performance of your models.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- At least 4 GB of RAM.
- A stable internet connection for installation.
- Python installed on your computer (preferably version 3.6 or higher).
